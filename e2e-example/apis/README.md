# OpenAPI manager example: APIs

This crate consists of example API traits under management. This is the base layer, and it depends on [`dropshot-api-manager-types`](../../crates/dropshot-api-manager-types) but _not_ on the higher-level [`dropshot-api-manager`](../../crates/dropshot-api-manager) crate.

For more information, see [the parent README](../README.md).
